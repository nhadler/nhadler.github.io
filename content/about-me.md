title: "About Me"
---

I'm a [chemistry](https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/chem) PhD candidate in the [Hartwig Group](https://hartwig.cchem.berkeley.edu/) at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/).

My research focuses on combining transition-metal catalysis with machine learning, data science, and high-throughput experimentation to accelerate discovery in synthetic chemistry. Broadly, I'm interested in how we can leverage domain knowledge to address challenges in applying machine learning to solve problems in the natural sciences, such as addressing data scarcity and developing better data representations for chemical problems. 

I have a strong background in synthetic chemistry, and I have experience in a variety of synthetic techniques, including air-free techniques, high-throughput experimentation, and reaction optimization. I'm very experienced in computational chemistry, especially in the context of transition-metal catalysis, as well as chemoinformatics, machine learning, software development, and data scienceâ€”including developing and applying new machine learning models and building useful tools for chemists.

I earned my BS in [Chemistry](https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/chemistry/) from the [University of South Florida](https://www.usf.edu/), where I worked with [Prof. Michael Shi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-fHWhYAAAAAJ&hl=en) on developing new synthetic methods using gold catalysis.

Outside of the lab, you can find me hiking, brewing coffee, tending to my vegetable garden, and throwing [pottery](https://art.nhadler.com/).
